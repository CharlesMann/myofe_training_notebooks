# MyoFE Tutorial Notebooks

This repository is created by Kurtis Mann and maintained by the Computational Biomechanics Lab at the University of Kentucky.  

Goal: Have a standard conda environment file that includes FEniCS 2019.1.0 and Jupyter-Lab, and anything needed for MyoFE. The following setup will require the command line.  

## Setting up your environment
First, make sure conda is installed. If you are unsure whether it is installed or not, you can check by doing the following:  
### Mac/Linux
Start a terminal session, and execute the command  
`conda list`  
If conda is properly installed, a list of installed packages for python and their versions will show up. If an error is encountered, [install conda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)

### Windows
_Kurtis, verify this on lab windows machine:_  
Open the Anaconda Prompt program, and execute  
`conda list`  
If conda is properly installed, a list of installed packages for python and their versions will show up. If an error is encountered, [install conda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)

If conda is properly installed, within the terminal/command prompt, navigate to the repository's environment file `myofe_environment.env`. It is in the top level directory of this repository.
